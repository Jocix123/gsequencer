  <title>The soundcard and sequencer interface</title>
  <para>
    With AgsSoundcard and AgsSequencer interface you can obtain information about
    output or input devices. Getting the next buffer for playback something can be
    achieved, too. As well reading MIDI data from current buffer is supported.
    Note these operations are performed all delayed in order to avoid concurrent
    memory access.
  </para>

  <para>
    Latency is at most one buffer time. Operations on buffers might be performed
    non-blocking so the thread returns earlier than expected. This has the advantage
    of controlling timings and let the thread continue to do more synchronization
    runs. Real-time behaviour is indicated as all pending sync operations were fulfilled
    as the next buffer is needed.

    <title>Gathering PCM information of soundcard</title>
    <para>
      In this short example we just get some information out of AgsSoundcard by using
      ags_soundcard_pcm_info(). It tells us the card identifier, minimum and maximum
      supported audio channels, samplerate and buffer size.
