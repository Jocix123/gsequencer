  <title>Putting all together</title>
  <para>
    So far we have seen the most important objects involved doing an audio processing
    tree. Now we want to do complete example putting all together. In this example we
    instantiate AgsAudioThread and AgsChannelThread to play a simple pattern. The sound
    we use is generated using a sinus wave.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    In order that the threads are used we provide an appropriate AgsConfig. Further we
    define an AgsPattern and add the needed recalls to do playback using the AgsRecallFactory.
