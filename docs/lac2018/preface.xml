  <title>Advanced Gtk+ Sequencer origin</title>
  <para>
    As a blood young hacker being naive and thinking doing all his goals within
    one 1 or maybe 2 years, the idea of free sequencer was developed. JoÃ«l
    recognized later, that his idea of a nested AgsRecycling tree, which provides
    some kind of "wormhole" to the ordinary setup with AgsAudio and AgsChannel,
    was important. But the entire code base needed to be implemented and it is going
    to take much more time.
  </para>

  <para>
    12 years later first major release was published. After hacking 4 years
    fulltime on GSequencer and as of version 1.2.7, the recycling tree should
    be working without bigger issues. The massive use of threads nowadays, just
    could be achieved because he was convinced of the "wormhole". This allows you
    to have 3 different multi-threaded scopes (playback, step-sequencer and notation).
