Advanced Gtk+ Sequencer
====

The gsequencer binary provides you a user interface. It allows you to play, capture and create music. There is a piano roll,
automation and wave form editor. It has machines for playing drum samples, Soundfont2 sound containers and synthesizers. They
usually can be connected to a MIDI input source (instrument). All sources need to be connected to the sink provided by AgsPanel,
thus the properties dialog from machine's context menu is responsible. The engine is extensible by following plugin formats:
LADSPA, DSSI and LV2. It has support for various audio backends like ALSA, Pulseaudio, JACK, OSSv4 and CoreAudio.

It is recommended to have a realtime kernel in conjunction with ags in order to do more computing expensive synthesis.

Please visit http://rt.wiki.kernel.org for more information.

Following site gives you advice in configuring ALSA

http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Low_latency_howto

You might want to disable systemd accounting.

https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.resource-control.html

$ systemd-run -p CPUAccounting=false -p MemoryAccounting=false -p TasksAccounting=false -p IOAccounting=false -p BlockIOAccounting=false --scope gsequencer

If you have pulseaudio running you might run `gsequencer` with pasuspender like:

$ pasuspender -- gsequencer

Purpose
====

The Advanced Gtk+ Sequencer framework is related to audio computation by representing it within a tree structure. It does various
abstraction and the base library can serve as fundament of any application.

libags provides an application context and a threaded tree. Which is synchronized by hard-realtime fashion. In terms of deterministic
dead-line. Each tic of the used threads has to fulfill its work in order to proceed. The file object might be used for light-weight
composition or persistency.

libags-audio is built upon libags and provides a tree of audio signals. They can be computed in parallel. One key feature is the
nested recycling tree. It allows to share audio data across channels. Further it avoids to wedge the parallel tree. There is support
for free plugin standards like LADPSA, DSSI and Lv2. So it does give support to read or write MIDI data.

libags-gui is a standalone library providing additional Gtk+-2.0 widgets.

GSequencer is the main application providing a Gtk+-2.0 GUI. Allowing you to edit or record notation. It is designed to be accessible
you should be able to control the entire application by keyboard. Likewise it implements various Atk interfaces. The frontend to AGS
requires to add machines by menubar and link them appropriately with properties dialog. It is available of the context menu. Note you can't
create any loops within the tree.

Build using mingw
====

The commands below might compile a native build of gsequencer on x86_64-mingw32 architecture using MinGW compiler assuming installing to
home directory. To perform a parallel build using 8 threads, invoke following commands in shell:

Follow the instructions on screen, edit configure.ac and Makefile.am or apply win32.patch.

$ git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/gnulib.git
$ ./gnulib/gnulib-tool --import langinfo regex signal-h sigaction strings sys_types memcpy
$ autoreconf -fi
$ ac_cv_func_malloc_0_nonnull=yes ac_cv_func_realloc_0_nonnull=yes ./configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --prefix=${HOME}/mingw64/target --disable-rt --enable-w32api --disable-alsa --disable-pulse --disable-jack --enable-wasapi --disable-x11
$ make -j8
$ make install
