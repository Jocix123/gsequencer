You need a realtime kernel in conjunction with ags in order to do more computing expensive synthesis.

Please visit http://rt.wiki.kernel.org for more information.

Following site gives you advice in configuring ALSA

http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Low_latency_howto

You might want to disable systemd accounting.

https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.resource-control.html

$ systemd-run -p CPUAccounting=false -p MemoryAccounting=false -p TasksAccounting=false -p IOAccounting=false -p BlockIOAccounting=false --scope gsequencer

If you have pulseaudio running you might run `gsequencer` with pasuspender like:

$ pasuspender -- gsequencer
