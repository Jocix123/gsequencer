It is recommended to have a realtime kernel in conjunction with ags in order to do more computing expensive synthesis.

Please visit http://rt.wiki.kernel.org for more information.

Following site gives you advice in configuring ALSA

You might want to disable systemd accounting.

https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.resource-control.html

$ systemd-run -p CPUAccounting=false -p MemoryAccounting=false -p TasksAccounting=false -p IOAccounting=false -p BlockIOAccounting=false --scope gsequencer

If you have pulseaudio running you might run `gsequencer` with pasuspender like:

$ pasuspender -- gsequencer

Purpose
====

The Advanced Gtk+ Sequencer framework is related to audio computation by representing it within a tree structure. It does various
abstraction and the base library can serve as fundament of any application.

libags provides an application context and a threaded tree. Which is synchronized by hard-realtime fashion. In terms of deterministic
dead-line. Each tic of the used threads has to fulfill its work in order to proceed. The file object might be used for light-weight
composition or persistency.

libags-audio is built upon libags and provides a tree of audio signals. They can be computed in parallel. One key feature is the
nested recycling tree. It allows to share audio data across channels. Further it avoids to wedge the parallel tree. There is support
for free plugin standards like LADPSA, DSSI and Lv2. So it does give support to read or write MIDI data.

libags-gui is a standalone library providing additional Gtk+-2.0 widgets.

GSequencer is the main application providing a Gtk+-2.0 GUI. Allowing you to edit or record notation. It is designed to be accessible
you should be able to control the entire application by keyboard. Likewise it implements various Atk interfaces. The frontend to AGS
requires to add machines by menubar and link them appropriately with properties dialog. It is available of the context menu. Note you can't
create any loops within the tree.
